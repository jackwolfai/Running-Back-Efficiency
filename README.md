# Running-Back-Efficiency
Script for analyzing your NFL running back data that explores the correlations between Speed Score, Rushing Efficiency, and performance metrics.

#### Key Features:

Correlation Matrix Heatmap - Shows all correlations between metrics
Multiple Scatter Plots - 6 different correlation analyses with trend lines and statistical significance
Distribution Analysis - Histograms, box plots, violin plots, and Q-Q plots
Performance Rankings - Composite scoring system and radar charts for top performers
Statistical Summary - Printed analysis with correlation coefficients and p-values

#### Key Insights the Code Will Reveal:

Speed Score vs Rushing Efficiency: Examines if bigger/faster players are more or less efficient
Speed Score vs TD Production: Tests if explosive athletes score more touchdowns
Multi-dimensional Analysis: Uses bubble plots to show 4 variables simultaneously
Performance Tiers: Groups players by TD production to analyze Speed Score patterns

#### Output:
The script generates 4 high-resolution PNG files:

- correlation_matrix.png
- scatter_analysis.png
- distribution_analysis.png
- performance_rankings.png

Plus a detailed statistical summary printed to console.
Simply run the script in Cursor or any Python environment with the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, numpy) installed.
